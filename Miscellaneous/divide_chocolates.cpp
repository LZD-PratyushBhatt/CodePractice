// You have many chocolates in a box, There can be multiple choclates of one type.
// Now consider these choclates are arranged in a row, then you have to find out, is there
// a way to divide chocolate into two parts, where each part will have unique number of choclate
// Note : Chocolate of one type, can be present in both the halves.
// Note2 : String will represent all the choclates, and each char of string corresponds to a chocolate
// Ex : If string is aaab, then you can divide it, because "aaa" and "b" are two partiions with 1 type each
// Ex2 : If string is aaabc, then also you can divide it, because "aab" and "ac" is one of the possible option
// If possible to divide, then return all the number of ways to divide.
